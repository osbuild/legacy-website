<p>Osbuild-composer 13 had numerous new exciting features but unfortunately,
several annoying bugs slipped into that release too. To address all these
issues, yesterday our team decided to roll-out an off-schedule bug-fix
release. Say hi to osbuild-composer 14.</p>

<p>The most important news is: AWS upload support got several fixes making it
more stable and the internal store can now handle manifests with a no longer
supported schema. Also, we dropped support for i686 architecture. Building
images for it was never supported and we now no longer provide i686 RPMs.</p>

<p>See the full changelog below.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>AWS uploads doesn’t anymore report to AWS that composer uploads
the image in vhdx format. This surprisingly makes the upload process
more stable.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Uploads were always in WAITING state. This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The /projects/source/* routes now correctly supports all the features
of Weldr API v1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AWS upload now logs the progress to journal. Even better logging is
hopefully coming soon.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AWS upload’s status is now correctly set to FAILED when ImportSnapshot
fails. Before, this hanged the upload indefinitely.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Store unmarshalling is now safer in some cases. For example, stored
manifests are now longer checked when loaded from disk. Therefore,
changing of manifest schema doesn’t lead to crashes when old manifests
are present in the store.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When store loading failed in non-verbose mode of osbuild-composer, it
crashed the process because of nil logger. This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upstream spec file for building osbuild-composer package now
excludes the i686 architecture. Note that composer never supported
this arch.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upstream spec file now correctly specifies the composer’s dependency
to osbuild-ostree. This was forgotten in the previous release which
introduced Fedora IoT support.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The previous version didn’t have repositories defined for s390x and
ppc64le architectures. This is now fixed. Note that this only fixes
some codepaths, osbuild-composer still cannot build any images on
these architectures.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
