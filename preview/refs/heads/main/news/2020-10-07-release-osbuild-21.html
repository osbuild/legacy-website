<p>We are happy to announce version 21 of <em>osbuild</em>. This release adds
support for running on Fedora 34. Furthermore, internal errors during
container setup are now properly reported. And lastly, a lot of work has
been done to improve the code readability.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official changelog from the <em>osbuild-21</em> sources. All
users are recommended to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The way that output of modules is communicated to osbuild was
re-factored in a way that now makes it possible to also capture
and log the output of the container runtime, i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bubblewrap</code>.
This should prove useful to track down errors where the runner
can not be executed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>runners: support for Fedora 34 was added</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A lot of internal re-factoring was done, to make the code nicer
and easier to read. For example the way objects are exported in
the pipeline is now unified.
Additionally, a dedicated API is used to fetch the arguments in
the modules, instead of relying on standard input.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
