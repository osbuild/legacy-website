  </section>
  <section>
<p>We are happy to announce version 11 of <em>osbuild-composer</em>, again one of our
regular biweekly releases. It now supports uploading images to Azure as well.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log, compiled by Ondřej Budai. Everyone
is encouraged to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The support for uploading VHD images to Azure is now available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AMI images are now produced in the vhdx format. This fixes the issue that
those images couldn’t be previously booted in EC2.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In version 10 the logs weren’t saved when osbuild failed. This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The warnings when upgrading/removing the RPM package are now fixed. Note that
updating to version 11 still produces them because the upgrade process runs
also the scriptlets from version 10.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The size calculation for Fedora 31 vhd images is fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The size field was removed from the tar assembler struct. The field has
actually never been supported in osbuild and it doesn’t make any sense.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The minimal required version of osbuild is bumped to 12.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This release also got big upgrades to the testing infrastructure, more tests
are run on a CI and they now run faster. Also, the unit test coverage is
improved.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
