<p>We are happy to announce that we released <a href="https://github.com/osbuild/koji-osbuild/releases/tag/v3"><em>koji-osbuild</em> 3</a>, our new project to
integrate <em>osbuild-composer</em> with <a href="https://pagure.io/koji">koji</a>, the build and
tracking system primarily used by the Fedora Project and Red Hat.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log, compiled by Christian Kellner.</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Ship tests in koji-osbuild-tests package. The tests got reworked so that they
can be installed and run from the installation. This will be useful for
reverse dependency testing, i.e. testing the plugins from other projects,
like composer as well as in gating tests.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the ability to skip the tagging. An new command line option, –skip-tag
is added, which translate into an a new field in the options for the hub and
builder. If that option is present, the builder plugin will skip the tagging
step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>builder plugin: the compose status is attached to the koji task as
compose-status.json and updated whenever it is fetched from composer. This
allows to follow the individual image builds.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>builder plugin: The new logs API, introduce in composer version 24, is used
to fetch and attach build logs as well as the koji init/import logs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>builder plugin: Support for the dynamic build ids, i.e. don’t use the koji
build id returned from the compose request API call but use the new
koji_build_id field included in the compose status response. This makes
koji-osbuild depend on osbuild composer 24!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>test: lots of improvements to the tests and ci, e.g. using the quay mirror
for the postgres container or matching the container versions to the host.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
