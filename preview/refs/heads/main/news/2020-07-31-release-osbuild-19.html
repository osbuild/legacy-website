<p>We are happy to announce version 19 of <em>osbuild</em>. After a rather long period
of development, this release comes with a wide range of new features and
improvements, as well as the usual round of bug fixes.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official changelog from the <em>osbuild-19</em> sources. All
users are recommended to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>osbuild is now warning if neither output-directory nor any
checkpoints were specified on the command line. No attempt
to actually build anything will be made.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fix a bug in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.osbuild.files</code> source where the timeout
was passed as a floating point value to curl, which in
certain locales would result in a comma being used for the
decimal separator, which can not be parsed by curl.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.osbuild.systemd</code> stage gained the ability to mask
services. Additionally, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">enabled_services</code> is not a required
option anymore.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.osbuild.script</code> stage has been dropped.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to pass in secrets via the command line has been
removed. It was only used by the deprecated <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dnf</code> stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The JSON schema was fixed for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.osbuild.noop</code> stage.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Stages and assemblers are now contained via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bubblewrap</code>
instead of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">systemd-nspawn</code>, which has many advantages,
including but not limited to: being faster, not requiring
root, better control of the contents of the build-root.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Internally, the logging of output and the communication
between the stages and the osbuild process on the host has
been reworked and cleaned up. This should allow better
monitoring in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The network of the sandbox that is used to run stages and the
assemblers is now isolated from the host network.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As always, lots of improvements to the testing infrastructure,
that should lead to better and quicker tests. Static analysis
is run nightly as well.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
