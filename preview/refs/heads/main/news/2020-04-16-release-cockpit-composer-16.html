<p>We are happy to announce version 16 of <em>cockpit-composer</em>, again one of our
regular biweekly releases.</p>

<p>This release adds the ability to upload to AWS. When creating an image 
compatible with AWS, a user has the option to upload the image to Amazonâ€™s EC2. 
This release also has minor changes to support the migration of the 
cockpit-composer repo on github to the OSBuild organization.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log, compiled by Jacob Kozol. Everyone
is encouraged to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The ability to upload to AWS has been added. The create image modal is
replaced with a wizard enabling additional customizations and
functionality. If the user creates an AMI the user can also enter the
credentials and parameters needed to upload this image to EC2 in AWS.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cockpit-composer has migrated from Weldr to the OSBuild github
organization. It can now be found at osbuild/cockpit-composer instead
of weldr/cockpit-composer.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Minor NPM updates have been made for React and Patternfly</p>
  </li>
</ul>
