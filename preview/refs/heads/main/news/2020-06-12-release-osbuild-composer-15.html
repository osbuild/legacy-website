<p>Today, we released osbuild-composer 15 with several very exciting features.
Most notably, Composer has now support for building RHEL For Edge and also
for building images for ppc64le and s390x architectures. Also, a lot of very
nice fixes are included in this release.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log. Everyone is encouraged to
upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Support for building RHEL for Edge is now available.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Composer has now support for building QCOW2 and tar images for ppc64le and
s390x architectures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tar images for RHEL have returned. The Image Builder team found out that
they are used as a way to install RHEL for Satellite.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Blueprints containing packages with a wildcard version no longer causes
the built image to have both x86_64 and i686 versions of one package
installed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GPG check is now disabled by default. If you have a custom
repository in /etc/osbuild-composer/repositories, just set gpg_check
to true to enable the check. Note that all the pre-defined repositories
have GPG check enabled.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Composer now supports a cancellation of jobs. This can be done by calling
/compose/cancel route of Weldr API.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>osbuild-composer previously crashed when osbuild didnâ€™t return the right
machine-readable output (e.g. because of a disk being out of space). This
is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Because of the GPG check change and RHEL for Edge support, composer
now requires osbuild 17 or higher.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>osbuild-composer previously required the python package to be installed
on RHEL. Now, it uses the always-installed platform-python.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The buildroot for RHEL 8 didnâ€™t have selinux labels before. This is now
fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>When Composer crashed, it left temporary directories in /var/cache. The
temporary directories are now moved to /var/tmp, which is managed by
systemd with PrivateTmp set to true, so theyâ€™re now correctly removed
after a crash.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Several weldr API routes were aligned to work in the same way as with
Lorax. /blueprints/freeze now correctly supports option to output TOML.
Projects and modules routes return all fields as Lorax returns.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AWS upload now logs the current state to the system journal. Emojis are
of course included. ðŸŽ‰</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As always, amazing improvements in the CI infrastructure happened. Also,
the test coverage went up. Thanks all for doing this!</p>
  </li>
</ul>
