<p>We are happy to announce that we released osbuild-composer 16 yesterday.
This release has no new features but contains a lot of useful fixes.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log. Everyone is encouraged to
upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>osbuild-composer now obsoletes lorax-composer on RHEL.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An upload failure (e.g. due to invalid credentials) now causes the compose
to appear as failed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RHEL 8 repositories are switched to the beta ones to allow composer to be
tested on 8.3 Beta. This will be reverted when GA comes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OSTree images no longer contains /etc/fstab. The filesystem layout is
determined by the installer and thus it doesn’t make any sense to include
it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If both group and user customizations were used, the user would be created
before the group, causing a build to fail. This is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Composer now correctly passes UID and GID to org.osbuild.{users,groups}
stages as ints instead of strings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The subpackages (worker, tests and rcm) now require a matching version of
osbuild-composer to be installed. Previously, they would be happy with
just an arbitrary one.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Support for testing OpenStack images in actual OpenStack is now available.
Note that upload to OpenStack is still not available for the end users
(it’s on the roadmap though).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worker now logs not only job failures but also job successes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>All DNF errors were mistakenly tagged as RepoError, this is now fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>As always, a lot of test and CI improvements are included in this release.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
