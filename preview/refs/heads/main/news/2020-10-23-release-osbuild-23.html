  <section>
<p>We are happy to announce version 23 of <em>osbuild</em>. This release makes it
possible to build Fedora on RHEL systems.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official changelog from the <em>osbuild-23</em> sources. All
users are recommended to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">org.osbuild.rpm</code> stage now includes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGPGP</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SIGGPG</code>
fields of each installed package in the returned metadata.
Additionally, its docs have been improved to specify what metadata
is returned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The spec file has been changed so that the shebang for assemblers,
stages and runners are not automatically mangled anymore. Runners
were already changed to have the correct shebang for their target
systems. Assemblers and stages are not meant to be run on the host
itself, but always inside a build root container, which must bring
the correct dependencies to run all stages and assemblers. For now,
Python3 (&gt;= 3.6), located at /usr/bin/python3, is required.
This change will enable building Fedora systems on RHEL hosts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Unit tests have been fixed to run on RHEL by dynamically selecting
a runner that is suitable for the host system.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The stages unit tests are now using generated manifests via mpp,
and have been updated to use Fedora 32. Additionally, the current
mirror was replaced with <a href="https://osbuild.org/rpmrepo"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rpmrepo</code></a>,
which should provide a faster, more reliable package source.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The CI has dropped Fedora 31 but instead includes Fedora 33 as
systems to run the composer reverse dependency tests for.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
