  <section>
<p>We are happy to announce version 10 of <em>osbuild-composer</em>, again one of our
regular biweekly releases. This release contains mostly bug fixes and internal
refactorings. We’ve also landed more integration tests and increased unit test
coverage.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official change log, compiled by Ondřej Budai. Everyone
is encouraged to upgrade!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The correct metadata_expire value is now passed to dnf. In the past, this led
to a lot of failed builds, because dnf has the default expire time set to 48
hours, whereas the Fedora updates repos have the expire time of 6 hours.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A decision was made that the minimal Go version required for building the
project is 1.12. This is now enforced by the CI.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The intermediate s3 object is now deleted after the upload to AWS is
finished. It has no value for users.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The upload to AWS has now a bigger timeout. The current coronavirus situation
is affecting the AWS responsiveness in a negative way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The weldr API has better test coverage. In the process, several bugs in
sources and composes were fixed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Worker and jobqueue packages are receiving a big refactoring.  This is the
prerequisite for having multiple job queues for building images for different
distributions and architectures.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The image tests now boot the AWS images in the actual EC2.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
