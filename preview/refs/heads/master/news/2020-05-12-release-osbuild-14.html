  <section>
<p>Last week, we released version 14 of <em>osbuild</em>. It is a regular release with a
handful of new features, as well as a bunch of fixes. The major new feature is
support for input-validation via JSON-schemata, as well as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--inspect</code>
command-line option to get more information about manifests without running the
pipeline engine.</p>

<p>This release is one week early, but we intend to continue bi-weekly releases.
However, from now on <em>osbuild</em> and its dependents (including <em>osbuild-composer</em>)
will release alternatingly.</p>

<p>Below you can find the official changelog from the <em>osbuild-14</em> sources. Go
forth and fetch it while it is hot!</p>

<hr />

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Schema validation: The osbuild python library gained support for
retrieving the metadata of modules and schema validation. This is
being used on each invocation of osbuild in order to validate the
manifest. Should the validation fail the build is aborted and
validation errors are returned, either in human readable form or
in JSON, if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--json</code> was specified.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">--inspect</code> command line option was added for osbuild. Instead
of attempting to build the pipeline, the manifest will be printed
to stdout in JSON form, including all the calulcated identifiers
of stages, the assembler and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tree_id</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">output_id</code> of the
pipeline (and build pipelines). Schema validation will be done and
errors will be reported.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Internally, the buildroot class now uses <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PYTHONPATH</code> to point to
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">osbuild</code> module instead of the symlinks or bind-mounts in the
individual modules.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fixes to the CI and many cleanups to the schemata, sample and test
pipelines as a result of the schema validation work.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
