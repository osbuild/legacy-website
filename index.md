# Build Reliable Operating System Images

Use **OSBuild** to create images of your linux operating system in a reliable
fashion, isolating the image creation from your host operating system, and
producing a reliable, well-defined image ready to be deployed.

**OSBuild** provides both the tools to build custom operating system images, as
well as applications to deploy hosted image building services. At its core, the
**osbuild** project takes the responsibility of assembling custom images of
operating systems according to the precise needs of the user. The **Composer**
project builds on top of **osbuild** and implements an image creation service
that can be deployed as a hosted service.
